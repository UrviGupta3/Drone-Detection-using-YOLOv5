# Drone-Detection-using-YOLOv5n
YOLOv5n is a lightweight and fast object detection model designed for real-time inference on resource-constrained devices. 
<br>
In this project, YOLOv5n was trained on a custom-labeled drone dataset to detect multiple classesâ€”drone, person, vehicle, and bird with efficient performance. Its small size makes it ideal for deployment on edge devices like the Raspberry Pi, ensuring accurate and low-latency detection in real-time environments.
